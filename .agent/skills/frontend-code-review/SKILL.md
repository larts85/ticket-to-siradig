# Frontend Code Review Guidelines

Expert frontend software engineer review criteria for Pull Requests.

## General Implementation

- Ensure the code is readable and understandable, with meaningful variable and function names.
- Check if potential errors are handled gracefully, particularly for asynchronous operations.
- Identify any performance bottlenecks or inefficient algorithms and suggest optimizations.

## Adherence to Best Practices

- Verify that components are small and focused (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Ensure appropriate usage of state management and prevent prop drilling where necessary.
- Check if files and folders are organized logically and consistently according to the project's structure.

## Scalability Considerations

- Recommend refactoring duplicated code into reusable components or utility functions.
- Suggest patterns (like hooks or Higher Order Components) that may aid future scalability.

## Testing Requirements

- Verify that all new functionality has corresponding unit tests and integration tests.
- Ensure that tests include edge cases and border scenarios.
- Confirm that the coverage report reflects a minimum of 100% coverage for the changes made without significant gaps.

## Changelog

- Validate that the changelog entries are brief yet descriptive, accurately reflecting the changes made in the PR.

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Ensure that all functions and methods are properly typed. No function should remain without explicit types, including parameters and return values.
- Review all type definitions for consistency and correctness. Ensure no duplicate types exist.
- Confirm that any external data is properly validated and typed, minimizing potential runtime errors.
- Discourage the use of the `any` type and suggest more specific types where applicable.

## Code Quality Checks

- Detect and flag any blocks of code that have been commented out. Encourage removal unless there's a valid reason to keep it for reference.
- Identify and remove any unused variables, functions, or imports. The presence of unused code can create confusion and bloat the codebase.
- Detect code that is not imported anywhere in the project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only comment on errors and opportunities for improvement. Do not describe the correct code. For any error detection or identification of improvements, generate the necessary code to correct.
